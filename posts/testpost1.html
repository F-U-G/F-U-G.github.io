          <h2>Installing Arch Linux for First Time</h2>
          <p>
            Today, I’ll be sharing my experience with Arch Linux. A few weeks
            ago, I installed Arch for the first time and, honestly, had no idea
            what I was doing. For those who aren’t familiar, Arch is an
            extremely bare-bones Linux distribution. You start with just the
            command line, and even to enable something like Bluetooth, you need
            to download a specific package. Now, you might wonder why anyone
            would put themselves through this. Well, for one, Arch is very
            lightweight and fast. Another reason for me was to learn more about
            what goes on behind the scenes in Linux. Unlike other distributions
            or operating systems, Arch forces you to understand every process
            happening on your PC. It’s not easy to learn, but pushing myself
            outside of my comfort zone was the only way I was going to become
            more proficient with Linux.
          </p>

          <h3>Getting started</h3>
          <p>
            I’m not going to cover the installation process here, as there are
            plenty of guides that do a great job explaining it. I will however,
            point you in the right direction to get started. The most important
            resource is the
            <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page">Arch wiki</a>,
            which has a great installation guide along with documentation
            specific to Arch on how various packages work. I also found some
            good videos on YouTube that helped quite a bit during installation.
            I used
            <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qboMuv9vSpQ&list=PL_JVnPgp2IRcFnHqZdmQwWdv8n49vGHqp&ab_channel=MischavandenBurg"
              >this playlist</a
            >
            from Mischa van den Burg's channel. It's long, so I recommend using
            the wiki installation guide then using this if you get stuck. I also
            found a channel called
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BreadOnPenguins"
              >BreadOnPenguins</a
            >
            thanks to the YouTube algorithm. Her videos helped me with a lot of
            the configuration I did after installing Arch.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, you'll need something other than your main PC or
            laptop to install Arch. You could go with a virtual machine or a
            cheap laptop. I went with the laptop option but if you don't have
            one laying around, just use a VM for free. After that just download
            the ISO from the Arch Linux website and follow the instillation
            guide.

          <h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
          <p>
            I've encountered many issues both during and after installation.
            There were a few moments where I thought I would have to reinstall.
            The thing is, you should never have to reinstall Arch. With enough
            persistence, you can look up your issue, change a config file,
            remove a package, reinstall a package, or whatever you need to do.
            Its also important to keep your installation drive with the Arch ISO
            on it. It can save you system from bigger issues, for example, I had
            an issue with my internet and I couldn't download any packages as a
            result. Using the installation drive, I was able to get my internet
            connection back and download the necessary packages to get it to
            work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of my friends call me tech-savvy, maybe I am, but that really
            doesn't matter. What I've realized is that any issue in programming,
            Linux, or computers can be solved with enough stubbornness. This can
            apply to anything in life, but your not going to get anywhere in
            Linux if give up as soon as it gets hard.

            Now that I have a decent Linux setup on my laptop, I've noticed a
            few small issues going back to Windows. The reason I started getting
            into Linux in the first place was because end of support for Windows
            10 in 2025, I also really don't like Windows 11. Now that I have
            this experience I am slowly going to make the transition to using
            Linux on my main PC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arch is definitely not for everyone, I would not recommend trying
            Arch as your fist Linux distribution. Start with something that has
            desktop environment, like Linux mint. Once you get used to basic
            commands and the file structure, then maybe consider Arch, but
            really you should try as many as possible.
